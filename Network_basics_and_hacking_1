Network Hacking: A. Pre- connection Attacks. (wired connection hacking)
		 B. Gaining Access. (wireless hacking to wifi)
                 C. Post-connection Attacks.

Network basics: 
    
>clients i.e users have access to the Resource(eg : internet ) through the Access point/Router. 

>no direct access to the users to the resources. 

>Access point is the only device that has a direct internet access i.e direct connection to the resource and Not the users.

>data transfer takes place as the packets in between the access point and the clients , acceccpoit and the resource.

Connect a usb device to a virtual machine. Needed ( Wireless wifi adapter: Requirements are: 1- Monitor mode, 2- packet injection, 3- AP mode)
Wireless adapters communicate with the available networks in the surroundings.

Note: Disconnect the usb wifi adapter physically if already connected.

STEPS: 1) run  ifconfig ( no wireless adapter will be shown on the interface)
       2) connect the usb adapter to the virtual machine. And run the ifconfig command again ( you will see the adapter is connected named wlan0)
       3) eth0 : used to connect to the virtual nat network
          lo : the loop back interface.
          wlan0 : the connected usb adapter.
       4) Wifi adapter is ready to use.

# Mac address: ( Media address control)
 An address given to aphysical electronic device , chip sets etc which is permanent , and unique.
 Mac adress is also called as the physical address of the device.
 
Mac adress is used between the network and used to identify the devices. while transferring the data.	
Each packet or data transferred in the n/w has a source mac and a deastination mac.
 
Why Change Mac addresses: > Will make you anonymus.
                	  > Impersonate other devices.
                	  > Bypass the filters.
                	  > Hide your identity.
                	 
How to change mac address: ( needs root access)
	Steps : 1) ifconfig ( get the network interface)
		2) ether in the eth0 shows the mac address of the virtual interface that your kali is connected to.
		3) ether part in the wlan0 shows the mac address of our usb router.
		
		4) Now disabling the interface in order to change the mac address of the wlan0: 
			> do ifconfig "interface name (wlan0) " down (ifconfig wlan0 down)
			> now run "ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:12:23:34:45:56 (you can use any address according to your choice make sure it starts with 00) " in order to change the mac address.
			> run ifconfig wlan0 up (to enable the interface)
			> run ifconfig (notice the change in the mac address)

Change to monitor mode: (Monitor mode help us capture any data/packet avilable in the network without the source and the destination address of the sender and reciever)
		> iwconfig
		> ifconfig wlan0 down
		> airmon-ng check kill
		> iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
		> ifconfig wlan0 up
		> iwconfig 
		this is used to break into the n/w. and snatch packets.
